# arXiv-NLP-Abstract-Clustering-Visualization
This project performs unsupervised clustering on Natural Language Processing research papers from the arXiv repository to identify thematic groupings and visualize the research landscape.  It leverages Sentence Transformers, UMAP, and HDBSCAN to embed, reduce, and cluster abstracts, producing a visual map of the NLP research domain.
